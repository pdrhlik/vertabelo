# My Vertabelo articles

This is a repository of articles that I write for [Vertabelo](https://academy.vertabelo.com/blog/). Every article has their own folder and contains an analysis in [R language](https://www.r-project.org/). They are written in [R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), a modified markdown that allows for including and executing R code.

## Article list

* [Going Down to South Park to Make a Text Analysis using R](/going-down-to-south-park-to-make-a-text-analysis-using-r)

   The article contains an analysis of South Park texts. You will see how an episode sentiment and IMDB episode popularity evolves over time. There are interactive plots and code examples on how to do the analysis on your own.
